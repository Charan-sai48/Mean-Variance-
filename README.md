# Mean-Variance-
## AIM:
To write a program for mean, variance and cross correlation in SCILAB and verify the output.

## EQUIPMENTS NEEDED:
•	Computer with i3 Processor<BR>
•	SCI LAB

## Algorithm
1.	Define	the	Function:	Specify the	function	you	want	to	simulate.	For	example, f(x)=sin⁡(x)f(x) = \sin(x)f(x)=sin(x) or any other function.
2.	Generate Sample Points: Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate these sample points within the desired range.
3.	Evaluate the Function: Compute the function values at each of these sample points.
4.	Compute Mean, Variance and Cross Correlation: Use Scilab's functions to calculate the mean and variance of the computed function values.
5.	Display Results: Output the computed mean variance and Cross Correlation

## PROCEDURE
•	Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.<BR>
•	Open SCILAB in System<BR>
•	Type your code in New Editor<BR>
•	Save the file<BR>
•	Execute the code<BR>
•	If any Error, correct it in code and execute again<BR>
•	Verify the generated results<BR>

## PROGRAM
```

```

## OUTPUT

## RESULT
Thus the mean and variance are executed in Scilab and output is verified
